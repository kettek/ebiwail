This repository contains 2 branches for using Ebitengine + Wails.

The `non-iframe` branch provides a full browser window experience with native JS interop, however the UI is overlayed on top of the game.

The `iframe` provides a version that can be placed and sized arbitrarily according to layout needs, however communication with Ebitengine is done via JavaScript message posting.

Each branch has instructions for usage.
